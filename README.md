## **[Javadocs Here](https://cmput301f24iconic.github.io/)**
## Overview
The **iconic-RaffleEvent Application** is an Android mobile application that allows users to sign up for popular events at community centers via a lottery system. This ensures a fair and accessible system for people who may have limitations like work or disabilities. Instead of first-come-first-served registration, users can express interest in an event and be selected via a lottery process. Event organizers can manage waiting lists and registrants efficiently, while entrants are notified if they win or lose the lottery.

## Features
- **Lottery System**: Organizers can draw participants from a waiting list.
- **QR Code Scanning**: Entrants can scan QR codes to view event details and join waiting lists.
- **Firebase Integration**: Stores event details, waiting lists, and real-time updates.
- **Multi-User Interaction**: Includes roles for entrants, organizers, and admins.
- **Image Upload**: Organizers can upload event posters.
- **Geolocation Verification (Optional)**: Optionally verify where users are joining the waiting list from.
